I'm a rising junior at Johns Hopkins majoring in Biomedical Engineering (BS/MSE'27 hopefully) and double minoring in Computer Science, and Entrepreneurship and Management. I'm currently an undergrad researcher at the [JEFworks Lab](https://jef.works/) at Hopkins and am interested in learning more about cancer immunotherapy, computational biology as well as applications of AI in contributing to healthcare solutions! I'm still debating whether to pursue a career as a scientist aka get a PhD, or work in industry, or maybe something entirely unrelated to my degree -- maybe something management/business/art related. Because outside of academics, I enjoy singing with my acapella group [Music Dynasty](https://jhu.campusgroups.com/musicdynasty/home/), hanging out with my friends, taking photography, and occassionally (m*stly) rotting in bed. Feel free to listen to my arrangement and solo cover of [Taylor Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fgtWDq8w3c&list=RD7fgtWDq8w3c&start_radio=1). My photo has been featured on [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01440-z) and my github profile picture was featured on my high school's Spectator Mazagine :)

What I've worked on in the past (mostly BME research):
- Simulated multi-cellular spots using single-cell spatially resolved transcriptomics data (MERFISH Ovarian Cancer data) to speed up spatial variable gene analysis while still maintaining high detection sensitivity and specificity.
- Contributed to development of [SEraster](https://jef.works/SEraster/) as an R/Bioconductor package.
- Used SEraster to characterize immunity hubs in a Visium HD single-cell CRC dataset.
- Performed spatial hallmark pathway analysis on Visium Murine GBM dataset.

5 Facts about me:
- I use emojis a lot! Angel emoji is a personal fav :D
- I performed at the [The Giant Egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Centre_for_the_Performing_Arts_(China)) when I was 6 as a background dancer.
- Fav artists: Taylor Swift, Adele, Maroon 5, Khalil Fong, Bruno Mars.
- I wear a lot of purple. My Bose headphone is lilac colored.
- Double-jointed (no wayyy).
